## Prompt

```

```

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive task list for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) educational module. The task list includes:

- 28 total tasks organized across 6 phases
- Phase 1: Setup tasks (T001-T004) for Docusaurus project initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks (T005-T006) for directory structure and navigation
- Phase 3: User Story 1 tasks (T007-T011) for voice-to-action implementation
- Phase 4: User Story 2 tasks (T012-T016) for LLM cognitive planning
- Phase 5: User Story 3 tasks (T017-T021) for capstone project demonstration
- Phase 6: Polish tasks (T022-T028) for cross-cutting concerns

Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. The tasks are organized by user story priority to enable independent implementation and testing. Parallel execution opportunities are identified for efficient development.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created for VLA educational module implementation
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (task planning phase)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with structured implementation plan
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation of individual tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks properly organized by user story with dependencies and parallel execution opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of Phase 1 setup tasks
